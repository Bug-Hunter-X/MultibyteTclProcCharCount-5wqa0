This repository contains a Tcl procedure that demonstrates a common error when working with character counting in strings containing multibyte characters. The `bug.tcl` file shows the flawed implementation that incorrectly counts multibyte characters, leading to inaccurate results.  The `bugSolution.tcl` file provides a corrected version that uses the `encoding` system to accurately count characters regardless of their encoding.  The issue is a subtle one, impacting developers working with internationalized or localized data.  The solution demonstrates a best practice for ensuring accurate character counting in Tcl.
